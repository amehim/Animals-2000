<h6>credit to wikipedia</h6><p>We live on a planet called Earth. As a species known as Homo Sapien Sapien a.k.a Humans, alongside 1.5 million other species. 1 million of which are insects. But what are animals exactly.</p>
<h3>What are Animals Anyway</h3>
<p>Animals are life so to see when animals came to be, we first have to see when life started. First, lets talk about Archean Earth. What is Archean? The Archean was an Eon tht started 4 billion years ago after the Haden. </p>

<p> Earth was very different back then. The atmoshere had a bunch of methane, ammonia, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, a stew called a reducing enviroment. What in the world does that mean? It means it makes elctrons free for chemical reactions.</p>
<img src="file:///C:/Users/18325/OneDrive/download%20(8).png">
<p> That was probably stellar news for the molecules that would make biological molecules and be able to react with each other to become more complex. But there is a catch. Really? Really. Carbon dioxide and methane are both greenhouse gases. They trapped heat in the atmosphere and make Earth much hotter, even though the Sun was 45% dimmer and younger.</p>

<p>There was also no evidence for polar iceaps or glaciers at the time and even into the Archean. It was way too hot for ice. At the same time, continents were solidifying. Plate tectontics have moved continents a ton scince then. But the innermost rocky parts of most of the continents we have today, date back to the archean, around 3.25 billion years ago. Back to 4 billion years ago at the start of the archean. In case you are wondering if the greenhouse gases wears of soon, three words. They. Do. Not. Volcanoes spew more greenhouse gases out into the atmosphere</p>

<p>There was also no oxygen, which also means no ozone layer. UV radiation roasted the planet. If you were to jump into the time machine and go to Earth back then, you might think you were on the wrong planet. A vast diffrence from the Nitrogen-Oxygen atmosphere and 57 degree temprature.</p>

<p> Soooooooo. What in the world happend. Life did. At some point in the warm oceans and greenhouse atmosphere, biological molecules with the information to copy themselves and had the ability to do so formed from organic compounds. These became bagged in an oily membrane that protected them from the dangerouse outside world. These were the first things to resemble a living cell.</p>
<img src="file:///C:/Users/18325/OneDrive/download%20(3).png">
<p>Eventually this early life morphed the atmosphere and climate. Some scientists believe that the earliest bio-moloecule was Ribonuclic Acid, or RNA, the molecule Deoxyribonuclec Acid or DNA uses to send info outside the cell. Et is called zee RNA world hypothosis. RNA is extremley similar to DNA but it's easier to make from simple components.</p>

<p> RNA also stores genetic info like DNA, but it can tangle itself into shapes that make it easier for chemical reactions to occur, the way proteins do now.</p>
<img src="file:///C:/Users/18325/OneDrive/download%20(5).png" alt="">
<p> The RNA world hypothesis would explain why RNA is the go-between for DNA and protein in our cells. But some scientists make an argument that it would be way too complicated for life to switch over from RNA to DNA and protein. So its more likely that all three evoled together. Whether life started as an RNA world or not, by the time that the common ancestor of everything alive today waltzed by, the system was Based on DNA. Now for the main question.</p>

<p>The earliest fossils show that life like of bacteria existed 3.5 billion years ago. But a more recent finding shows that life could be even older. A team of Californian scientists found evidence for life that is 4.1 billion years old.  Now, there weren't any rocks older than 4 billion years which means there aren't any fossils either. But the team found 656 resillrnt zircons, which can be preserved when the rocks sorrounding them is destroyed. Then they get icorpurated into new rock.</p>

<p>The Zircons that were found in australia contain traces of 4.1 billion years old.</p>
